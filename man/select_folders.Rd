\usage{
select_folders(
  base_path = ".",
  pattern = NULL,
  match_all = FALSE,
  full_path = FALSE,
  ignore_case = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_path}{Character string specifying the directory path to search in.
Default is current directory (".").}

\item{pattern}{Character vector of patterns to match folder names against.
Default is NULL (returns all folders).}

\item{match_all}{Logical value indicating whether all patterns must match (TRUE for AND logic)
or any pattern can match (FALSE for OR logic). Default is FALSE.}

\item{full_path}{Logical value indicating whether to return full paths (TRUE)
or just folder names (FALSE). Default is FALSE.}

\item{ignore_case}{Logical value indicating whether to ignore case when matching patterns.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A character vector of folder names or full paths, or NULL if no matches found.
}
\description{
This function selects folders from a specified directory based on pattern matching.
It can match multiple patterns using either AND or OR logic.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all folders in current directory
select_folders()

# Get folders containing "data" in current directory
select_folders(pattern = "data")

# Get folders containing either "data" or "test", case sensitive
select_folders(pattern = c("data", "test"), ignore_case = FALSE)

# Get folders containing both "DATA" and "Test", case insensitive
select_folders(pattern = c("DATA", "Test"), match_all = TRUE)

# Get folders from specific path
select_folders(base_path = "D:/workspace", pattern = "data")

# Get full paths instead of just folder names
select_folders(pattern = "data", full_path = TRUE)

# Using regular expressions with case sensitivity
select_folders(pattern = "^Data[0-9]", ignore_case = FALSE)
}
