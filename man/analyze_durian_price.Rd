\title{Durian Price Analysis Function}
\usage{
analyze_durian_price(
  price_per_500g = 29.9,
  flesh_rate = c(0.25, 0.4),
  weight_jin = 5,
  flesh_weight_jin = NULL,
  flesh_price = NULL,
  total_flesh_price = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{price_per_500g}{Numeric. Price per 500g of durian (default: 29.9)}

\item{flesh_rate}{Numeric vector. Flesh rate range, can be a single value or a range (default: c(0.25, 0.40))}

\item{weight_jin}{Numeric. Durian weight in jin (default: 5)}

\item{flesh_weight_jin}{Numeric. Flesh weight in jin (default: NULL)}

\item{flesh_price}{Numeric. Flesh price per jin (default: NULL)}

\item{total_flesh_price}{Numeric. Total flesh price (default: NULL)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the analysis results with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item Parameter: The name of the parameter
\item Value: The calculated value or range
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes durian prices and flesh weights based on different input parameters.
It can work in three modes:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate from durian weight: Given the weight of a whole durian, calculate the expected flesh weight and total price
\item Calculate from flesh weight only: Given the flesh weight, calculate the possible durian weight range and price range
\item Calculate from flesh parameters: Given any two of flesh weight, flesh price, and total flesh price, calculate the original durian price range
}
}
\examples{
# Mode 1: Calculate from durian weight
# Calculate expected flesh weight and total price for a 5-jin durian
analyze_durian_price()

# Calculate for a 8-jin durian with custom flesh rate
analyze_durian_price(weight_jin = 8, flesh_rate = c(0.30, 0.45))

# Mode 2: Calculate from flesh weight
# Calculate possible durian weight range for 2 jin of flesh
analyze_durian_price(flesh_weight_jin = 2)

# Mode 3: Calculate from flesh parameters
# Example 1: 2 jin of flesh at 60 yuan per jin
# This will calculate the total price and original durian price range
analyze_durian_price(flesh_weight_jin = 2, flesh_price = 60)

# Example 2: 2 jin of flesh with total price of 120 yuan
# This will calculate the price per jin and original durian price range
analyze_durian_price(flesh_weight_jin = 2, total_flesh_price = 120)

# Example 3: Flesh price of 60 yuan per jin with total price of 120 yuan
# This will calculate the flesh weight and original durian price range
analyze_durian_price(flesh_price = 60, total_flesh_price = 120)

# Note: All weights are in jin (1 jin = 0.5 kg)
# The function will automatically handle unit conversions internally
